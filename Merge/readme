This script will loop through centralities 1-9 for a specific energy and merge the root files produced in the path "../New_Cuts/" (you can change this).

To Run:
bash or ./merge.sh

The merged files are in the format: cen#_energy.merge.root. 

If you want to do another energy, change "my $energy = 7;" in line 37 to whatever energy you want.
