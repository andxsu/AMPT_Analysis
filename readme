1. This is a sample code for running AMPT
       Sample_code.cpp
You can work on 27 GeV data set first, and use for other datasets.
Check #49, to change the input data file 
Check #58, 171, 175, 191 to change the output root file namd and directory

Each input data has roughly 2000 events, each event represents Au+Au collision
at different centrality (a random beam impactor of b); Thus, the output files
are categorized by the "centrality" = 0-5% (cen=9) means b=0 fm, most central events;
centrality = 70-80% (cen=1) means b ~ 70%*2*Radius of Au, most peripheral case.

To test the code, run on cen = 5, mid-central events, 30-40% centrality first.

2.To test the code:
root -b -q Sample_code.cpp

then you may start to write your own anaysis.


3. if you are sure that the code works well, loop over files
bash run.sh


4. download
scp -r zhiwanxu@169.232.156.216:/media/Disk_YIN/AMPT-27GeV/cen5.AMPT_Correlation_job100.root .

upload
scp -r Sample_code_test.cpp zhiwanxu@169.232.156.216:/media/Disk_YIN/AMPT-27GeV/



 I hope both of you have access to our local machine Dingo.
 I prepared some sample code to run the AMPT model, here:
    /media/Disk_YIN/AMPT-27GeV/analysis-zhiwan/Sample_code.cpp

 please check the readme file in the directory:
   /media/Disk_YIN/AMPT-27GeV/analysis-zhiwan/readme

 First, you can create a working directory in Disk_YIN because the space is larger here.
 then, copy the "Sample_code.cpp" and "run.csh" to your working directory,
 test the code, play with it a bit, and we may discuss it before you start your analysis.


 For Andrew, we can start calculating the v2 for cen1-cen9 with psi=0,
 at 27 GeV, 7 GeV, and 11 GeV.
 The 11 GeV data has not yet been uploaded, so I hope you can start the 27 GeV first.

Based on what we discussed yesterday, I hope you can first calculate v2 at 27 GeV for centrality 1 (70-80%).
 After you analyze the full set of data, you can merge the root files with
   /media/Disk_YIN/AMPT-27GeV/analysis-zhiwan/Merge
 Again, first copy this directory to your workspace,
and then check the readme file and you will see the details.
